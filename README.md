Use the OpenWeather One Call API (https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. Read through the documentation for setup and usage instructions. You will use localStorage to store any persistent data.

This application is for looking at the weather in a chosen city, either same day, or in a 5 day forecast. It also will show the humidity, wind speed, and UV Index. It will save past searches to for easy access to pull up the conditions for that city again.
